My Rock Paper Scissor pseudocode:

function getComputerChoice() {
	let Number = Random Number between 1 and 3
	make 1: Rock
	make 2: Paper
	make 3: Scissor
}

function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
	return several strings according to result like:
	-> "You lose! Paper beats Rock!"
	-> "You win! Rock beats Scissors!"
	-> etc.

	Inside the function: make playerSelection case-insensitive with
	.toLowerCase() and to .toUpperCase() and .slice()
}

const playerSelection = "rOcK";
const computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));

=> Here make some tests with the debugger console and refresh the page repeatedly to test if it works properly

function game() {
	play 5 rounds of the game
	
	make a loop that iterates until 5 and then stops
	
	or call the playRound() function 5 times in a row and then make a conclusion
	
	console.log(results of each round and the winner)
	
	prompt(get Input from user like "Please choose between Rock, Paper or Scissor: ")
	
	Return Results and winner
}

Play around with the code, make it more smooth and adjust it

My Rock Paper Scissor pseudocode:

function getComputerChoice() {
	let Number = Random Number between 1 and 3
	make 1: Rock
	make 2: Paper
	make 3: Scissor
}

function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
	return several strings according to result like:
	-> "You lose! Paper beats Rock!"
	-> "You win! Rock beats Scissors!"
	-> etc.

	Inside the function: make playerSelection case-insensitive with
	.toLowerCase() and to .toUpperCase() and .slice() and concatenation
}

const playerSelection = prompt("Please choose between Rock, Paper or Scissor:", "");
const computerSelection = getComputerChoice();
console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));

=> Here make some tests with the debugger console and refresh the page repeatedly to test if it works properly

function game() {
	play 5 rounds of the game
	
	make a loop that iterates until 5 and then stops
	
	or call the playRound() function 5 times in a row and then alert the result
	
	console.log(results of each round and the winner)
	
	prompt(get Input from user like "Please choose between Rock, Paper or Scissor: ")
	
	Keep score and declare winner and loser

	Change return values to "Win", "Lose" and "Draw" and give winning points (win: 2, draw: 1, lose: 0)
}

Play around with the code, make it more smooth and adjust it

Implementing an UI:

Instead of prompting the player via prompt(), we get the input from pressing the buttons rock, paper and scissors

Instead of alerting the player vie alert() about the results, we write the results as a text into a div
below the buttons as follows:

There are 6 <div>s that I create after every game:
1. <div> Result of first Round
2. <div> Result of second Round
3. <div> Result of third Round
4. <div> Result of fourth Round
5. <div> Result of final Round
6. <div> declare winner and loser. play again?

I want to player to be informed what he played and what the computer played ✓

I want the player to know if he won the round, lost the round or had a draw ✓

I want the player to be able to start a new game by pressing a button ✓

I want to erase the results of the previous round ✓

I want the player to be informed about the total score in the end 

I want some formatting, style and colors with CSS
